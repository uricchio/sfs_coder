The guts of sfs_coder
*********************

sfs_coder has an object oriented structure.  The main classes are Mutation,
Simulation, and SFSCommand.  The Mutation class stores detauls relevant to
each variable site in the simulation (including sites that have fixed in the
output).  The Simulation class stores details relevant to every mutation 
within the simulation or the simulation as a whole (such as the number 
of simulated loci and the distances between them) and provides a number of 
methods for analyzing data.  The SFSCommand class stores details that pertain 
to command lines and allows for building commands and analyzing data.

In the next few subsections, I discuss a few relevant details of the 
organization and use of each class, but please refer to the section
``sfs_coder Classes and methods'' section of this documentation for further 
details.

Mutation class
==============

Each Mutation instance has several attributes which correspond to the output
from SFS_CODE.  Briefly, SFS_CODE outputs a comma delimited string similar to
the following for each mutation within a simulation:

0,A,483,5574,5676,GGG,T,1,G,C,-4.613899e-03,5,2.1080,2.1850,2.2951,2.3299,2.4194;

Each field is explained in detail in the sfs_code documentation 
(sfs_code.sourceforge.com).  The correspond to 

1) locus number (0-based)
2) Autosomal/X/Y 
3) position in locus (0-based)
4) Generation mutation occurred 
5) Generation mutation fixed (time of sampling if not fixed)
6) Ancestral tri-nucleotide
7) Derived nucleotide
8) Synonymouys (0) or non-synonymous (1) (0 is used for non-coding)
9) Ancestral amino acid
10) Derived amino acid
11) Fitness effect (s)
12) Number of chromosomes that carry mutation 
13) comma delimited list of chromosomes carrying mutation (-1 indicates all chromosomes)
