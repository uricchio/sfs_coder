Forward simulation is a powerful tool for understanding the impact of
evolutionary forces on genetic 
variaiton.  Forward simulation can generate sequence data under arbitrarily 
complex models that include positive and negative selection as well as complex 
demography.  This level of generailty is difficult to model analytically and is 
not provided by other simulation frameworks such as the coalescent.  However,
populaiton genetic simulators can be daunting to master because of the 
vast number of input options and the density of the output data.    

sfs_coder is a python based front end to the popular forward simulation 
software SFS_CODE.  It allows python programmers to easily execute and analyze 
simulations performed with SFS_CODE.  It is free to use and distribute for 
personal or academic use.  We hope that you will find it useful.
